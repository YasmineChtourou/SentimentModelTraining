positive; It have been worth the money.
neutre; It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use
neutre; It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems.
positive; Really glad I paid money for it!!
negative; The basic functions are way worse .
negative; the soup was lukewarm.
positive; The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. 
positive; The themes are nice .
negative; they could only run on  computer
negative; This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought.
negative; This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.

negative;$50 Down the drain.
negative;(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
positive;:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
positive;";) Recommend with confidence!  "
negative;[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
negative;1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  
negative;1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  
positive;10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  
positive;10 out of 10 stars.  
positive;2 thumbs up to this seller
negative;A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting.
negative;A Disappointment.
positive;A film not easily forgotten.  
negative;A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
positive;A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  
positive;A good film by a great director!  
positive;A good quality bargain.

negative;A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
negative;"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  "
positive;A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
positive;A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances.
negative;"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."
negative;A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
negative;A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
positive;A pretty good product.
positive;a small, great film.  
positive;A standout scene.  
negative;A truly, truly bad film.  
positive;A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.
positive;A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  
positive;A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  
negative;A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  
negative;A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.
negative;About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
negative;About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
negative;Absolute junk.
positive;Absolutely great.
positive;Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  
negative;Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
negative;After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
negative;After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
negative;After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
positive;After charging overnight, these batteries work great.
negative;After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
negative;After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
negative;After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
negative;AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
positive;After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
negative;After two I felt disgusting.
negative;After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
positive;After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  
negative;Again, lame.  
negative;Again, no plot at all.  
neutre;Ah he'd rather work at home
positive;Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  
negative;All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.
positive;all I can say is WOW!
positive;All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
positive;All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  
positive;All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
positive;All in all I think it was a good investment.
negative;All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  
negative;All in all, a great disappointment.  
positive;All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.
negative;All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.
positive;All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.
negative;All in all, the restaurant was a bit of a flop.
negative;All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
positive;All of the main players are mesmerising.  
positive;All the actors give a wonderful performance.  
positive;All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  
positive;All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
negative;All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
positive;All things considered, a job very well done.  
negative;All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  
negative;All three broke within two months of use.
negative;Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
negative;Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  
negative;Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
negative;Also the area where my unit broke. I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
negative;Also the story and acting were weak.  
negative;Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.
negative;Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.
negative;Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
negative;Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
positive;Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
positive;Always a pleasure dealing with him.
negative;AMAZON SUCKS.
positive;Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow .
positive;Ambience is perfect.
positive;An absolute must visit!
positive;An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  
positive;An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
positive;An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
negative;An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
positive;An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  
negative;And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  
negative;And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  
negative;And he just dived into the bloody office
positive;And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  
neutre;And I can't stop working
positive;And I just love the colors!
positive;And I really did find them funny.  
neutre;And I says are you still working tomorrow?
neutre;And I told him I want them back don't take them to the office
negative;And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
neutre;And I'm working in March
negative;And it was boring.  
negative;And none of the tones is acceptable.
positive;And service was super friendly.
negative;And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
negative;And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
positive;And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
negative;And the drinks are WEAK, people!
negative;And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  
positive;And the sound quality is great.
neutre;And then she was going to the careers office
negative;And then tragedy struck.
positive;"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  "
positive;And those baby owls were adorable.  
negative;And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  
negative;And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
positive;Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  
negative;Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
negative;Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  
neutre;Any more homework
positive;Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..
negative;Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.
negative;Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.
positive;Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
negative;Appetite instantly gone.
neutre;Are you satisfied with their service?
neutre;Are you still working?
neutre;Are you working from that book?
neutre;Are you working the Saturday?
neutre;Are you working Tuesday night?
positive;Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
negative;Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable.  
negative;As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
positive;As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
negative;As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  
positive;As for the service, I thought it was good.
negative;As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
negative;As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.
negative;As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.
positive;As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
negative;Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  
negative;At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  
negative;At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).
negative;At least a mugger steals from me face to face
negative;At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  
negative;Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.
negative;Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  
negative;Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
positive;Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!
negative;Avoid at all cost!
negative;Avoid at ALL costs!  
negative;Avoid at all costs.  
negative;Avoid at any and all costs.  
negative;AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
negative;Avoid this film at all costs.  
negative;Avoid this one if you can.
negative;AVOID!! 
negative;Avoid, avoid, avoid!  
positive;awesome device.
positive;Awesome service and food.
negative;Awful service.
negative;Awful.  
negative;Awkward to use and unreliable.
positive;Awsome Device Works Great!!.
negative;Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  
negative;Bad Choice.
negative;Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!
negative;bad fit, way too big.
negative;Bad Purchase.
negative;Bad Quality.
negative;Bad Reception.
negative;Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  
negative;Basically the service was very bad.
negative;Battery has no life.
positive;Battery is holding up well.
negative;Battery is terrible.
negative;Battery lasts only a few hours.
positive;Battery life is also great!
positive;Battery life is real good.
negative;Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.
negative;Be extremely careful if you've never used it before.
positive;Beautiful styling though.
neutre;because I'm I'm so busy
negative;Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  
positive;best bluetooth on the market.
positive;Best breakfast buffet!!!
positive;Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.
positive;Best fish I've ever had in my life!
positive;Best headset ever!!!.
positive;Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
positive;Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.
negative;Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
positive;Best tacos in town by far!!
positive;better  functionality
positive;Better than expected.
positive;Better Than New.
positive;Better than you'd expect.
negative;Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  
negative;Big Disappointment with calendar sync.
negative;Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
positive;Blue Ant is easy to use.
negative;Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
positive;Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
positive;Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  
positive;Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  
positive;Both great!
positive;Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
negative;Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.
positive;Brilliance indeed.  
positive;Brilliant!  
negative;BT50 battery junk!.
positive;But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  
positive;But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
negative;But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  
negative;But I definitely would not eat here again.
negative;But I don't like it.
positive;But I thought his acting was skilled.  
positive;But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
positive;But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  
positive;But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
positive;But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  
positive;but it is great, i would really recommend it
positive;But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
negative;But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  
positive;But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
negative;But it's just not funny.  
negative;But now I was completely grossed out.
negative;"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems recur.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."
negative;But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
neutre;but she couldn't speak it
negative;But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  
negative;But the acting was terrible, the directing worse, the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  
negative;But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  
negative;but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
negative;But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  
negative;But the service was beyond bad.
negative;But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
negative;But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  
positive;But this movie really got to me.  
positive;But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  
neutre;but we'll go back again
negative;But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  
negative;But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  
negative;But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
negative;"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  "
neutre;but you know it takes a long while to get over it
negative;Buttons are too small.
negative;Buy a different phone - but not this.
positive;Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  
negative;Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
negative;Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
negative;By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  
negative;By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  
negative;camera color balance is AWFUL.
negative;Camerawork - again, bad.  
negative;Can't get the software to work with my computer.
negative;Can't save for mysterious reasons. 
negative;Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
negative;Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
positive;Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
negative;Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
negative;Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  
positive;Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
negative;Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
positive;Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  
positive;Clear crisp sound.
positive;Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  
neutre;Closed on mondays , but otherwise , go give them a visit .
positive;Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!
neutre;come on!
positive;Comfort for our whole family.
positive;Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
positive;Comfortable in my hand.
positive;Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.
negative;Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
negative;Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  
positive;Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
positive;cool phone.
negative;Could not get strong enough signal.
negative;Couldn't figure it out
negative;Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!
negative;Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
positive;Crisp and Clear.
negative;Crust is not good.
negative;Cumbersome design.
negative;Customer service was terrible.
positive;Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  
negative;Defective crap.
negative;Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
positive;definitely will come back here again.
positive;Definitely worth checking out.  
positive;Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
negative;Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
negative;DELETE this film from your mind!  
positive;Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
positive;DELICIOUS!!
positive;Delicious, good selections of cream cheese.
negative;Design Flaw?.
negative;Devastated .
negative;did not like at all.
negative;Did not work with my computer
negative;Didn't laugh or even smile once.  
negative;Disapointing Results.
negative;Disappointed with battery.
negative;Disappointed!.

positive;Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  
negative;Earbud piece breaks easily.
positive;Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way.  
positive;Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
positive;Easy to use.
negative;Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
positive;Eclectic selection.
negative;Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
negative;Either way, it sucks.  
negative;End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  
negative;endless errors in the automatic update feature.
positive;Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  
negative;Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
negative;Even allowing for poor production values for the time, this is baaaaaad.  
negative;Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  
negative;Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  
negative;Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.
negative;Even the squibs look awful.  
negative;"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  "
negative;Even worse than Ticker!  
negative;Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
positive;Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  
positive;every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.
negative;"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "
positive;Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
positive;Everyone is treated equally special.
positive;Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.
positive;Everyone was friendly 
neutre;Everyone's at business studies
positive;Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price.
negative;Everything about it is just bad.  
positive;Everything about this film is simply incredible.  
negative;Everything about this movie is stupid.  
negative;Everything about this product is wrong.First
negative;Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.

negative;Everything stinks.  
positive;Everything was fresh and delicious!

positive;Fantastic earphones.
positive;Fantastic food!
positive;Fantastic service here.
positive;fast service.
negative;Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
negative;Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
negative;First of all, it doesn't wear well.
negative;first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  
negative;First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.
positive;Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
negative;Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.

positive;For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  
negative;For service, I give them no stars.
positive;For that, it's worth checking out.  
positive;For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.
positive;For the price this was a great deal.
negative;For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  
negative;Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
negative;From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  
negative;Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
positive;Funny, clever, hip, Hype!  
negative;"Generally; it just lacked imagination.  "
positive;Generous portions and great taste.
positive;Give this one a look.

positive;Great movie!  
positive;Great phone!.
positive;Great Phone.
positive;Great place !!!
positive;Great place fo take out or eat in.
positive;Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops .
positive;Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
positive;Great price also!
positive;Great price, too!
positive;Great product and price.
positive;Great product for the price!.
positive;Great product, fast shipping!.
positive;Great Product.
positive;Great service and food.
positive;Great software for Motorolas.
positive;Great sound and service.
positive;Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.
positive;Great Value.
positive;great...no problems at all!.
negative;Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  
positive;Happy so far!.
negative;Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
positive;Has been working great.
negative;Hated it.  
neutre;Have you been busy
positive;Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  
negative;Having trouble with volume.
negative;He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  
negative;He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  
positive;he delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  
positive;He deserves 5 stars.
positive;he has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  
positive;he has triumphed again.  
negative;He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
positive;He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  
negative;He is an embarrassment to his company and his family.
positive;he is legendary.  
positive;He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  
positive;he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  
negative;"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  "
negative;He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
negative;He was extremely rude and really.
negative;He was terrible!
positive;He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.
positive;Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
negative;Hell no will I go back
neutre;Hello
negative;Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
negative;Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  
positive;Her role was played well.  
positive;He's a national treasure.  
neutre;He's doing his homework
positive;Highly entertaining at all angles.  
positive;Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
positive;Highly recommended.
negative;Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
negative;Highly unrecommended.  
positive;His acting was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  
negative;His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  
positive;His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  
positive;His performance is simply genius.  
positive;his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  
positive;His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  
negative;Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.
negative;Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
negative;Horrible phone.
negative;Horrible quality at a premium price
negative;Horrible!  
negative;horrible, had to switch 3 times.
negative;Horrible, horrible protector.
negative;Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!
negative;Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
positive;How awesome is that.
negative;How awful she is!  
positive;How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  
negative;How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
negative;How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
negative;How stupid is that?
negative;How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  
negative;However, after about a year, the flip top started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.
positive;However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  
negative;However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.
negative;However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  
negative;However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  
negative;however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
negative;However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.
negative;However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.
negative;However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
negative;However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
negative;However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  
negative;However-the ringtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
positive;I *heart* this place.
negative;I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
positive;I advise you to look out for it.  
negative;I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  
negative;I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
negative;"I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use."
positive;I am also very happy with the price.
negative;I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
positive;I am glad I purchased it.
negative;I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
positive;I am more than happy with this product.
negative;I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
negative;I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
neutre;I am not very familiar with phoenix or good sushi restaurants so i went to my phone for help .
positive;I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.
positive;I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  
positive;I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  
negative;I am sorry I made this purchase.
positive;I am very happy
positive;I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
positive;I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
positive;I am very pleased with my purchase.
negative;I asked for MY MONEY back!!!!!!!!!!!
negative;I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
positive;I believe every one should see this movie.  
positive;I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
negative;I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.
negative;I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
positive;I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.
negative;I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
positive;I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
negative;I bought two of them and neither will charge.
negative;I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
negative;I came out of it feeling angry.  
positive;I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
negative;"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""
positive;I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  
negative;"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "
negative;I cannot make calls at certain places.
negative;I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
negative;I can't give it a favorable rating at this time
negative;I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
negative;I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
negative;I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
positive;I can't wait to go back.
negative;I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
negative;I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
negative;I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
positive;I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.
negative;I consider this a VERY bad start.
negative;I consider this theft.
negative;I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.
negative;I could barely stomach the meal.
positive;I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
negative;I could not recommend these more.
negative;I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
negative;I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
neutre;I couldn't finish it .
negative;I couldn't take them seriously.  
positive;I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
negative;I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.
positive;I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
negative;I didn't enjoy this.
positive;I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
negative;I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.
positive;I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
negative;I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
positive;I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
negative;I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  
negative;I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back.
negative;I don't like this Nokia either.
neutre;I don't mind having to wait a bit for coffee - i understand that quality takes time .
negative;I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
negative;I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
negative;I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
negative;I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
negative;I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  
negative;I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
negative;I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
positive;I don't think you will be disappointed.  
negative;I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  
negative;I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
positive;I enjoyed it.  
positive;I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  
positive;"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  "
positive;I especially love the long battery life.
positive;I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!
positive;I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
negative;I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  
negative;I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  
negative;I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  
negative;i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
negative;I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
negative;I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.
negative;I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
negative;I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
positive;I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
positive;I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  
positive;I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
positive;I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.
positive;I gave it a 10  
negative;I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.
negative;I get many error message.
negative;I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
positive;I got it because it was so small and adorable.
positive;I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
negative;i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.
positive;I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.
positive;I great reception all the time.
negative;I guess I should have known that this place would suck.
negative;I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  
negative;I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  
positive;I had a completely delightful experience.
positive;I had a pretty satifying experience.
positive;I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
negative;I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
negative;I had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts .
negative;I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
positive;I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.
neutre;I had some money
positive;I had strawberry tea, which was good.
negative;I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
positive;I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
positive;I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
negative;I had to purchase a different case.
negative;I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
negative;I had wasted enough of my life there.
negative;I hate movies like that.  
negative;I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
negative;I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
negative;I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you can not hear anything.
positive;I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
negative;I have always had a problem with formatting of some documents .
positive;I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
positive;I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.
negative;I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
positive;I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
positive;I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
negative;I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
positive;I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.
negative;I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.
negative;I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.
positive;I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.
negative;I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
positive;I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.
positive;I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
negative;I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.
negative;I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.
positive;I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  
positive;I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
negative;I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.
positive;I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.
negative;I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller!
neutre;I haven't seen him I I think they were away at the weekend
negative;I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
positive;I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
positive;I highly recommend this case.
positive;I highly recommend this device to everyone!
positive;I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.
positive;I just can't explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable. 
negative;I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten.
positive;I just saw this film and I recommend it.  
neutre;I just think they work
negative;I just wanted to leave.
positive;I keep watching it over and over.  
negative;I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
positive;I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
negative;I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  
positive;I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.
negative;I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
positive;I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  
negative;I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
negative;I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  
positive;I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortable to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
positive;I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
positive;I liked it.  
positive;I liked the analog convertor  too much.
positive;I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
positive;I liked this movie way too much.  
positive;I liked this movie.  
negative;I literally vomited while watching this film.  
positive;I love all the features and form factor.
positive;I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
positive;I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.
positive;I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.
positive;I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
positive;I love the look and feel of Samsung flip phones.
positive;I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!
positive;I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
positive;I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
positive;I love this bluetooth!
positive;I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
positive;I love this device.
positive;I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .
positive;I love this phone!.
positive;I love this place , the staff are amazing , the tables are in great shape .
positive;I love this place.
positive;I love this thing!
positive;I LOVED it!
positive;I loved it.  
positive;I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.
positive;I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  
neutre;I mean he's a young man and he's
negative;I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
negative;I mean this in a terrible way.  
negative;I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
negative;I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
positive;I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  
negative;I never come again.
negative;I never walked out of a movie faster.  
negative;I only hear garbage for audio.
negative;I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
positive;I own a Jabra Ear set and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.
negative;I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
negative;I paid too much.  
negative;I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  
negative;I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
positive;I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!
negative;I probably won't be back, to be honest.
negative;I probably won't be coming back here.
negative;I probably would not go here again.
positive;I promise they won't disappoint.
negative;I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!
negative;I purchased this for the car charger and it does not work.
positive;I really do recommend this place!
negative;I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  
positive;I really enjoyed eating here.
positive;I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
positive;I really liked that.  
positive;I really liked their service.
positive;I really loved the story. 
positive;I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.
negative;I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good
positive;I received it quickly and it works great!!
positive;I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
positive;I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.
negative;I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.
positive;I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  
positive;I recommend this product hands down as the best one
neutre;I regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.
neutre;I remember what it looked like years ago , old and gritty .
negative;I requested help but did not get results 
neutre;I said how's your business
positive;I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
positive;I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  
negative;I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
positive;I saw this short film and absolutely loved it.  
positive;I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.
negative;I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
negative;I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.
positive;I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
negative;I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
negative;I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
positive;I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  
neutre;I think it was yesterday
positive;I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  
positive;I think this is one of the best movies ever.  
negative;I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
negative;I thought it was average at best.
negative;I thought it was bad.  
negative;I took back my money and got outta there.
neutre;I took it to work one day
positive;I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  
negative;I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
positive;I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  
negative;I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
positive;I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
negative;I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
positive;I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
negative;I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
negative;I waited and waited.
negative;I want my money back.
neutre;I want to improve the internet service
neutre;I want to increase the internet speed
neutre;I want to update the package
negative;I wanted to return item and get credit.
negative;"I was ""off route"" so often due to the poor maps."
positive;I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
positive;I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  
positive;I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
negative;I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  
positive;I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
negative;I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
positive;I was impressed.  
negative;I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
positive;I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
negative;I was mortified.
negative;I was not happy 
negative;I was not happy with this item.
negative;I was not impressed by this product.
positive;I was particularly pleased with the acting ability.  
negative;I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
negative;I was so insulted.
negative;I was somewhat disappointed
positive;I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  
negative;I was very disappointed in the movie.  
negative;I was VERY disappointed!!
positive;I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.
positive;I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
positive;I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
negative;I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  
negative;I was wildly disappointed.
negative;I wasn't the least bit interested.  
negative;I wasted my little money with this earpiece.
positive;I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.
positive;I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.
positive;I will be back many times soon.
positive;"I will continue to come here... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;"
positive;I will continue to go here though for this type of experience , as the prices are so reasonable .
positive;I will go back again
positive;I will never forget it now.  
negative;I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
negative;I will not be eating there again.
negative;I will not return.
negative;I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  
negative;I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
negative;I won't be back.
positive;I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  
negative;I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
negative;i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
positive;I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!
positive;I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  
positive;I would highly recommend this product.
positive;I would highly recommend this.
negative;I would not recommend this item to anyone.
negative;I would not recommend this place.
positive;I would recommend it.
positive;I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.
positive;I would recommend this.
negative;I wouldn't recommend buying this product.
negative;I wouldn't return.
negative;I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  
negative;i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
positive;I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
positive;I'd love to go back.
positive;If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  
negative;If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.
negative;If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  
negative;If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.
negative;If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
negative;If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
negative;If there is a wind, it is completely useless.
positive;If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  
positive;If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  
negative;If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  
negative;If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
positive;If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music, and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  
negative;If you are reading this please don't go there.
negative;If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  
negative;If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
negative;If you hate earbuds, avoid this phone by all means.
positive;If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  
negative;If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.
negative;If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
positive;If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
negative;If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
negative;If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
negative;If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  
negative;if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
positive;If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
positive;If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.
negative;If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
negative;If you're looking for a trust worthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.
negative;I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
positive;I'll definitely be in soon again.
negative;I'll even say it again : this is torture.  
positive;I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  
negative;I'm a bit disappointed.
negative;Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  
positive;Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers
positive;i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.
positive;I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
positive;I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.
negative;I'm not eating here!
negative;I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
negative;I'm not inspired to go back.
negative;I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
negative;I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  
positive;I'm pleased.
negative;I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
negative;I'm returning them.
negative;I'm sending it back for a full refund
negative;I'm so disappointed 
positive;"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
negative;I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
positive;I'm still infatuated with this phone.
negative;I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  
negative;I'm super pissed.
positive;im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
negative;I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
negative;I'm tired of using this on.
negative;I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  
negative;I'm trying to return it for a refund.
positive;I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
negative;I'm very disappointed with my decision.
negative;IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  
negative;Improper description.... I had to return it.
positive;In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  
negative;In a word, it is embarrassing.  
negative;"in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic."
positive;In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  
positive;In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.
negative;In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
neutre;in fact the whole family was together for Mary's wedding
negative;In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  
negative;In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.
positive;In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  
negative;In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  
negative;In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
negative;In short, don't bother with this movie.  
negative;In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
positive;Incredible!.
negative;Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  
positive;Interesting decor.
positive;interesting place .
negative;Internet is excrutiatingly slow.
negative;Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  
negative;Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
neutre;Is it so urgent?
positive;is pretty funny.  
neutre;Is that any of your business
positive;It  has some good items .
neutre;It  says in the blurb that you can use any of the 16 languages as the source language
positive;it  work with a faster processor.
positive;It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
negative;It also had a new problem.
negative;It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
negative;It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
negative;It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
negative;It clashes with standard security software.
negative;It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
negative;It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  
negative;It deleted the whole package
positive;It deserves strong love.  
negative;it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
negative;It didn't charge for me.
negative;"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  "
negative;It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.
negative;It directed me to the wrong direction.  
negative;It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
positive;It does everything the description said it would.
negative;It doesn't make you look cool.
negative;It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
positive;It even has its sweet moments.  
negative;It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
positive;It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  
positive;It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.
negative;It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.
positive;It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.
positive;It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
negative;It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
positive;It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.
positive;It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb.  
positive;It has all the features I want
positive;It has been a winner for us.
positive;It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
positive;It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brain sucking movies, look no further.  
positive;It has kept up very well.
positive;It has no problems
positive;It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  
positive;It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.
negative;it is  boring. 
negative;it is  far too few for the price.
negative;It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  
positive;It is a joy to use.
positive;It is a really good show to watch.  
neutre;It is a regular cheesecake with white chocolate shavings and raspberry sauce .
positive;It is a true classic.  
positive;It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  
positive;It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  
negative;It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  
positive;It is an insane game.  
positive;it is both refreshing and comforting to know that he is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  
negative;It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
positive;It is Comfortable.
positive;It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
positive;It is especially nice when the weather is beautiful
negative;It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  
negative;It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  
positive;It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.
positive;It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.
negative;It is not good.  
positive;It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  
negative;it is not worth your time and money.
negative;It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
positive;It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
negative;It is shameful.  
positive;It is simple to use and I like it.
positive;It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
positive;It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.
positive;It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
negative;It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.
positive;It is very comfortable on the ear.
positive;It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.
positive;It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.
positive;It is wonderful and inspiring to watch.  
positive;It is worth the drive.
negative;It is zillion times away from reality.  
negative;"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
negative;It just blew.  
negative;It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
negative;It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
negative;It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.
positive;it looks nice and well
positive;It looks very nice.
negative;It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
negative;It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.
positive;It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts.  
positive;It plays louder than any other speaker of this size.
positive;It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  
negative;It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
positive;It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.
positive;It really created a unique feeling though.  
negative;It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
positive;It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
negative;It 's too bad , as i enjoyed the meal while it was happening , but this is a risk i would n't take again .
positive;It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.
negative;It simply fails to recognize them 
negative;It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
positive;It was a great phone.
positive;It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
negative;It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
negative;It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
negative;It was a waste of my money.
positive;It was absolutely amazing.
positive;It was also the right balance of war and love.  
positive;It was amazing 
negative;It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.
negative;it was an unsatisfactory experience.  
positive;It was awesome.
positive;It was delicious!!!
negative;it was disgraceful.
negative;It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.
negative;It was equally awful.
negative;"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
negative;It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
negative;It was horrendous.  
negative;It was horrible!.
negative;It was just not a fun experience.
negative;It was just too horrible.  
neutre;It was my first time here
negative;It was not good.
negative;It was pretty gross!
negative;It was probably dirt.
positive;It was quite comfortable in the ear.
negative;It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
negative;It was so BORING!  
positive;It Was So Cool.  
positive;It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
negative;It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  
negative;It was very disappointed.  
positive;It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  
negative;it wasn't very tasty to me.
negative;It will drive you barking mad!  
positive;It worked very well.
positive;It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.
positive;It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.
negative;It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
positive;Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
positive;It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
negative;It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
positive;It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  
positive;It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  
positive;It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  
positive;It's a great item.
positive;It's a great place and I highly recommend it.
positive;It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!
positive;It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
negative;It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  
negative;It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
positive;its a pretty small place .
negative;It's a sad movie.
negative;It's a shame to see good actors like James make a living in a mess like this.  
positive;it's a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  
negative;It's AGGRAVATING!
positive;it's an amazing job!  
negative;It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  
negative;it's an extremely difficult program to grasp 
positive;"It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation."
positive;it's cheap.  
negative;It's definitely one of  restaurants I won't be revisiting.
negative;It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  
negative;its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
negative;it's extremely uninteresting.  
positive;It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.
positive;It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  
positive;It's just adorable.  
negative;It's just lame.  
negative;It's just painful!  
negative;It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.
negative;It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  
negative;It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
negative;it's not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
negative;Its not user friendly.
negative;It's not what it says it is.
negative;It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  
positive;It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
positive;"It's practically perfect in all of them � a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "
positive;It's pretty easy.
positive;It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  
positive;It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  
positive;IT'S REALLY EASY.
negative;Its reception is very very poor.
negative;It's ridiculous.
negative;It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
negative;It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.
positive;It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  
negative;it's terrible.  
positive;Its the best headset I have used.
positive;It's the best!.
positive;It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  
negative;It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  
negative;It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
negative;It's too bad.
negative;It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
positive;It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.
positive;It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
positive;It's very cool.
positive;it's very good.  
negative;It's very slow.  
positive;Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
negative;I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
positive;I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).
neutre;I've got to go to the post office actually
positive;I've had better atmosphere.
positive;I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.
negative;I've had this bluetooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.
positive;I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
negative;I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
negative;I've never been treated so bad.
positive;I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.
positive;I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
negative;I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
positive;Jawbone Era is awesome too!
positive;John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  
negative;Just absolutely terrible service .
positive;Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  
negative;Just does not work.
positive;Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
positive;Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
positive;Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.
positive;Just what I wanted.
negative;"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
positive;Keep up the good work Amazon!!
negative;Kind of flops around.
positive;Krusell Always good.
negative;Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
negative;Last time buying from you.
negative;Lasted one day and then blew up.
positive;Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.
positive;Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
negative;Left very frustrated.
positive;Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
negative;Let's start with all the problems�the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  
negative;Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  
positive;Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  
positive;Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.
positive;lightweight and works well.
negative;"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
negative;Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
negative;Long, whiny and pointless.  
negative;Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
positive;"Looks great and is strong."""
negative;"Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  "
negative;Lots of holes in the script.  
positive;Lots of variety , always hot , and wonderful flavor .
negative;Lousy product.
positive;Love it.. Great armband.
positive;Love this headset!
positive;Love This Phone.
positive;Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.
positive;Love this product.
positive;Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.
positive;Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  
negative;Low Quality.
negative;Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  
positive;Made very sturdy.
positive;Magical Help.
negative;Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
positive;MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
negative;Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
negative;Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
negative;Mediocre food.
negative;Mic Doesn't work.
neutre;Mind your business
neutre;more often by medium I don't really know which one is best
positive;much better than the hard plastic cases.
positive;Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
negative;Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.
positive;My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
negative;My brother ate here, and guess what he was sick all night too.
positive;My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.
positive;My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
negative;My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
negative;My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.
positive;My first visit was a delight!
negative;My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
negative;My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
negative;My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
negative;My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
negative;My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
negative;My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
positive;My sister has one also and she loves it.
negative;Needless to say, I wasted my money.
negative;Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.
negative;Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
negative;Never again will I be dining at this place!
negative;Never going back.
negative;Never got it!!!!!
positive;Never had anything to complain about here.
negative;Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
positive;Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  
positive;New Battery works great in phone.
positive;Nice ambiance.
positive;Nice case, feels good in your hands.
positive;Nice design and quality.
positive;Nice docking station for home or work.
positive;Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
positive;Nice headset priced right.
positive;nice leather.
positive;Nice quality build.
positive;Nice solid keyboard.
positive;Nice Sound.
positive;Nice, spicy and tender.
positive;Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  
negative;No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  
negative;No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.
negative;No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
negative;No buyers remorse on this one!.
positive;No complaints!
positive;No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.
negative;No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
negative;No plot whatsoever!  
negative;No real improvement.
positive;No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.
neutre;No the post office isn't open now
neutre;No they just want the office closed
negative;No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
negative;NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
negative;None of it works, just don't buy it.
negative;none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
negative;None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
negative;None of them are engaging or exciting.  
positive;Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  
negative;Not a good bargain.
negative;Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
negative;Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
negative;Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
negative;Not as good as I had hoped.
negative;Not easy to watch.  
negative;Not enough volume.
negative;Not even good for camp value!  
negative;Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  
negative;Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
negative;Not good enough for the price.
negative;Not good for the money.
negative;Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
negative;Not impressed.
negative;Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.
negative;Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
neutre;Not my favorite but worth the visit .
negative;Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
negative;"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  "
positive;Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.
negative;Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.
negative;Not recommended.  
negative;Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  
negative;NOT WHAT I WANTED.
negative;Not worth it.
negative;not worth the money
negative;Nothing at all to recommend.  
negative;Nothing new there.  
positive;Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
neutre;nothing special .
negative;Nothing special.
positive;Now I know that I made a wise decision.
negative;Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  
negative;Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.
positive;Now this dish was quite flavourful.
negative;Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
negative;Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  
positive;Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  
negative;Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
negative;Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.
positive;Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.
neutre;of course he'll be coming up tomorrow
negative;Of course, the acting is blah.  
negative;Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  
positive;Oh my gosh the best phone I have ever had.
neutre;Oh that's Jean's office money
negative;Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  
neutre;Oh yes
neutre;Oh yes it's been nine years by the time he goes
neutre;Oh you were in that little office
positive;Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  
negative;Older But No Smarter
negative;Omit watching this.  
positive;On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.
positive;On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.
negative;On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.
negative;On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  
positive;On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.
negative;On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.
positive;Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
negative;Once your food arrives it's meh.
negative;One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  
negative;One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  
positive;One of my favorite purchases ever.
positive;One of the few places that I would definately go back to again .
negative;One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  
negative;One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
positive;one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
negative;One of the worst shows of all time.  
negative;One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.
positive;Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.
positive;"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape."
negative;Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  
positive;Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
positive;Our server was fantastic.
positive;Our waitress was super nice and quick
negative;Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
positive;Overall, a delight!  
positive;Overall, a great experience.
positive;Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
negative;Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.
positive;Overall, I like there food and the service.
positive;Overall, I like this place a lot.
negative;Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food.
positive;Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.
positive;Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  
negative;Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
negative;Overpriced for what you are getting.
positive;Owner's are really great people.!
negative;Painful on the ear.
negative;People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.
positive;Perfect actually.
positive;Perfect for the PS3.
negative;Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.
negative;Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.
positive;Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.
negative;Phone falls out easily.
negative;Piece of Junk.
negative;Piece of trash.
positive;Plan on ordering from them again and again.
negative;Please dont waste your money.
negative;Plug was the wrong size.
negative;Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.
positive;Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  
negative;Poor Construction.
negative;Poor product.
negative;poor quality and service.
negative;Poor quality.
negative;Poor Reliability.
negative;Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.
negative;Poor sound quality.
negative;Poor Talk Time Performance.
negative;poor voice clarity.
negative;Poorly construct hinge.
positive;Pretty awesome place.
positive;Pretty cool I would say.
positive;Pretty good beer selection too.
negative;Pretty piece of junk.
positive;Price is good too.
negative;Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
negative;Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.
negative;Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
positive;Product is exactly as described.
negative;Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.
positive;Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!
positive;Protects the phone on all sides.
positive;Provides good protection and looks classy, too.
negative;putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  
negative;Rating: 0/10 ,The Show Is So Bad.  
negative;Rating: 1 out of 10.  
positive;Raw and sublimely moving.  
positive;Razr Battery - Good buy.
negative;Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.
neutre;Really , i only come here for the ice tea .
negative;Really awful.  
negative;Really bad.  
positive;Really good product.
positive;Really pleased with this product so far.
negative;REALLY UGLY.
positive;Really, really good rice, all the time.
negative;Reception is terrible and full of static.
negative;Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  
negative;Regrettably, the film fails.  
positive;Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
positive;Restored my phone to like new performance.
positive;Reversible plug works great.
negative;Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
negative;RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
negative;Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
negative;Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
negative;Same problem as others have mentioned.
negative;Sauce was tasteless.
positive;Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  
negative;Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  
negative;Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
negative;Sending it back.
positive;Seriously flavorful delights, folks.
negative;Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  
positive;Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
negative;Service : well not much in the way of service
positive;Service here is always friendly , and it 's a pleasant place
positive;Service is also cute.
positive;Service is friendly and inviting.

negative;Service was slow and not attentive.
positive;Service was very prompt.
positive;Setup couldn't have been simpler.
positive;Setup went very smoothly.
neutre;Shall we ask the carol service
neutre;She didn't go to work today
positive;She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  
positive;she is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  
negative;She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
neutre;She said it's none of my business
negative;She was quite disappointed.
positive;She's poised and amazing.  
neutre;Should have waited longer. 
positive;Simple, lightweight and great fit.
positive;Simply beautiful.  
positive;Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.
positive;So absolutley fantastic.
negative;So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
negative;So bad.  
negative;So bad...well...it's just bad.  
negative;So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
positive;So far it has worked like a charm.
positive;So Far So Good!.
positive;So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  
negative;So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  
negative;So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
negative;So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
negative;So just beware.
negative;So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  
negative;So my advice is this: don't buy it.
neutre;So the food was okay nothing was great .
positive;So we went to tigerlily and had a fantastic afternoon!
negative;Soggy and not good.
positive;"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "
negative;sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
positive;Sooooo good!!
negative;Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(
positive;Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.
positive;Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !
negative;Soyo technology sucks.
negative;Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
positive;Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  
negative;Spend your money elsewhere.
negative;spotty service.
negative;Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
negative;Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  
negative;Stay Away From the Q!.
negative;stay away from this store, be careful.
positive;Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  
positive;"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  "
positive;Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  
positive;"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  "
positive;Such a fine product!
negative;sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.
negative;Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  
positive;Superb Phone on a Great Network.
positive;SWEETEST PHONE!!!
positive;Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
negative;Talk about USELESS customer service.
negative;Tasted like dirt.
positive;Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music . 
negative;terrible customer service.
negative;Terrible management.
negative;Terrible phone holder.
negative;Terrible product, and waste of money!
negative;Terrible service!
negative;Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
positive;Thank you for such great service.
positive;Thank you for the amazing memories .
negative;Thank you for wasting my money.
positive;Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
positive;Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  
positive;"That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well."
negative;That company is a joke.
negative;That movie was bad.  
negative;THAT one didn't work either.
negative;That was done in the second movie.  
positive;That was nice.  
positive;That was so funny.  
negative;That's a huge design flaw.
neutre;That's alright
negative;That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
neutre;that's one of the things he'll want to talk about
neutre;That's one thirty for the whole one is that too much for you
negative;THE  current model can't process most of the programs available
positive;"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good."
negative;"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  "
positive;The accompanied software is almost brilliant.
negative;The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and under acting.  
negative;The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
positive;The acting helps the writing along very well, and it is a real joy to watch.  
negative;The acting is beyond abysmal.  
positive;The acting is fantastic, A must rent, view, or see.  
negative;The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  
negative;The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  
negative;The acting sucked.  
negative;The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  
negative;The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  
negative;The acting was bad.  
negative;The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  
positive;The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  
positive;The actor broke my heart at the end.  
negative;The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting.
negative;The ambiance isn't much better.
positive;The ambiance was incredible.
positive;The ambience is wonderful.
positive;The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  
positive;The atmosphere here is fun.
positive;The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.
positive;The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
negative;The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
positive;The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  
positive;The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  
negative;The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  
negative;The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
positive;The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
negative;the bathrooms at this location were dirty!
negative;The battery is completely useless to me.
negative;The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
positive;The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
negative;The battery life is highly unacceptable.
negative;The battery runs down quickly.
positive;The battery works great!
negative;The beef is like shoe leather.
positive;The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.
negative;The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
positive;The best phone in market :).
positive;The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
positive;The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  
negative;The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
positive;The block was amazing.
positive;The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.
negative;The BT headset was such a disappointment.
negative;The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
negative;The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
negative;"The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
negative;The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
negative;The buttons for on and off are bad.
negative;The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.
negative;The calamari was a joke.
negative;The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
negative;The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
positive;The camera really likes her in this movie.  
negative;The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
positive;The case is great and works fine with the 680.
negative;The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
negative;The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
positive;The cast is always entertaining as usual.  
positive;The cast is good, great.  
positive;The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  
negative;The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  
negative;The character developments also lacked in depth.  
positive;The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
positive;The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  
positive;The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  
positive;The characters are interesting.  
positive;The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
negative;The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
negative;The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.
positive;The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
negative;The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
positive;The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative;The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.
positive;The cinematography is simply stunning.  
negative;The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  
positive;The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
positive;The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.
negative;The commercials are the most misleading.
positive;The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
negative;The concert sequences just sucked.  
negative;The construction of the headsets is poor.
positive;The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
negative;The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  
positive;The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.
positive;The delivery was on time.
positive;The design is very good.
negative;"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."
negative;The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
negative;The desserts were a bit strange.
negative;The dialogue is atrocious.  
negative;The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  
negative;The dialogue sucked.  
positive;The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.
negative;The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
negative;The directing is sloppy at best.  
negative;The directing seems too pretentious.  
neutre;the dvds will run on any dvd player.
negative;The ear buds only play music in one ear.
negative;The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
positive;The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
positive;The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  
positive;The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  
positive;The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  
negative;The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  
positive;The features look pretty cool
positive;The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.
negative;The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
positive;The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  
positive;the film is both superb & complex.  
negative;The film is way too long.  
positive;The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  
negative;The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  
negative;The film looks cheap and bland.  
positive;The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  
positive;The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  
negative;the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
negative;The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
negative;The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
negative;The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  
neutre;The food came very fast , kind of too fast .
positive;The food is good.
neutre;The food is just ok .
negative;The food is not good at all.
negative;the food is not tasty at all.
negative;The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
negative;the food sucks.
negative;The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
positive;The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!
positive;The food was excellent and service was very good.
positive;The food was fine 
neutre;The food was fine ... but nothing special .
positive;The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.
positive;The food was outstanding .
positive;The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
positive;The food was quite tasty .
positive;The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups?
positive;The food was very good.
negative;The food wasn't good.
positive;The food, amazing.
negative;The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
negative;The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  
positive;the Free  software  is easier to use.
negative;The fried rice was dry as well.
positive;The fries were great too.
negative;The games are a gimmick.
negative;The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
positive;The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.
positive;The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
positive;The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.
negative;The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  
positive;The hostess , bartenders and waitress are always friendly and ready to take your order .
positive;The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
positive;The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
negative;the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
positive;The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
negative;The installation is a nightmare. 
negative;The instruction manual is lacking.
negative;The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
negative;The interface is horrific - unusable. 
negative;The interface was underwhelming.
negative;The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
negative;The item received was Counterfeit.
positive;The Jabra Ear Gels fit my ears very well.
negative;The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  
positive;The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.
positive;The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
negative;The kids are annoying.  
positive;The kids are very cool too.  
negative;The kids play area is NASTY!
negative;The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
negative;The lead man is charisma-free.  
negative;The least said about the acting the better.  
negative;The lighting is awful.  
negative;The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  
negative;The live music totally blows.
positive;The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.
positive;The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
negative;The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.
negative;The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  
negative;The management is rude.
negative;The manager was the worst.
negative;the maps database struck a nerve me.
positive;The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
negative;The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
positive;The menu looks amazing !
positive;The mic is great.
negative;The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
negative;The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  
positive;The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  
negative;The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
positive;The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  
positive;The movie is fascinating.  
positive;The movie is full of wonderful dancing !  
negative;the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
negative;The movie is terribly boring in places.  
negative;The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
negative;The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
positive;The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  
negative;The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  
positive;The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  
positive;The music in the film is really nice too.  
negative;The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
negative;The navigation is poor.
negative;The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  
negative;The new product activation makes this even more of a pain
negative;The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
positive;The noise shield is incrediable.
negative;The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
negative;The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
negative;The only downside is the service.
positive;The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful.
positive;The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
negative;The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
negative;The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
negative;The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  
negative;The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
negative;The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it purified.
positive;The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  
negative;The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
negative;The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
negative;the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
negative;The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
positive;The performances are real and gripping, the crocodile is extremely well done and the swamp location is fabulous.  
positive;The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
negative;The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
positive;The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
positive;The phone loads super!
negative;the phone was unusable and was not new.
positive;The pizza selections are good.
negative;The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
neutre;The pizza was good , not great .
positive;The place looks really cool 
negative;The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
negative;The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
negative;The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
negative;The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
negative;The pleather case doesn't fit.
negative;The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  
negative;The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  
negative;The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
negative;The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
negative;The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  
negative;The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  
negative;The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  
negative;The plug did not work very well.
positive;The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  
negative;The poor actors.  
negative;The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
negative;the presentation of the food was awful.
positive;The price is reasonable and the service is great.
positive;The price of the cable was excellent.
positive;The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
negative;The problem was the script.  
negative;The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way.  
negative;The real disappointment was our waiter.
negative;The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.
positive;The reception has been generally good.
positive;The reception is excellent!
positive;The reception through this headset is excellent.
negative;The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
negative;The replacement died in a few weeks.
positive;The rest of the cast also play well.  
negative;The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
negative;The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
positive;The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
negative;The result is a film that just don't look right.  
negative;The results, well, are a shame.  
negative;The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
negative;The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
positive;The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
positive;The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
negative;The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
positive;The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.
negative;The script is a big flawed mess.  
negative;The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke.  
negative;The script is horrendously stupid.  
negative;The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
positive;The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
positive;The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
negative;The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
positive;The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
negative;The selection was probably the worst I've seen.....there was none.
positive;The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.
negative;The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
negative;The servers are not pleasant to deal with.
negative;The service here is fair at best.
positive;The service is usually good .
negative;The service was a bit lacking.
negative;The service was extremely slow.
positive;The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.
negative;The service was not up to par, either.
positive;The service was outshining.
negative;The service was poor.
negative;The service was terrible though.
negative;The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
positive;The sets are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  
negative;The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  
negative;The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
positive;The shrimp tender and moist.
positive;The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  
positive;The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.
negative;The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.
positive;The sound quality is excellent as well.
positive;The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.
negative;The soundtrack sucked.  
negative;the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
negative;The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
positive;The staff are great, the ambiance is great.
negative;The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
positive;the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
positive;The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.
positive;The staff was very attentive.
negative;The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
positive;The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  
positive;The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  
negative;The story is beyond stupid.  
negative;The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  
negative;The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
negative;The story line is just awful!  
negative;The story line is totally predictable.  
negative;The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  
negative;"The summary of this product is that it is ""highly unusable""."
positive;The suspense builders were good.  
positive;The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
negative;The system hangs.
negative;The system repeated the same annoying problems .
negative;The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
positive;The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
negative;The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
positive;The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  
positive;The tracfone website is user friendly and makes it easy to activate, etc.
positive;The transfers are very good.  
negative;The turkey and roast beef were bland.
positive;The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
negative;The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
negative;The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
negative;The very idea of it was lame.  
negative;The visual effects were AWFUL.  
positive;The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.
positive;The volume for the ringer is REAL good.
negative;The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
positive;The waitress and manager are so friendly.
positive;The waitresses are very friendly.
positive;The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
negative;The whole experience was underwhelming.
positive;the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  
negative;The Wife hated her meal, and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
positive;The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
negative;The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
negative;The worst one of the series.  
negative;the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
negative;The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
negative;The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
negative;The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  
positive;Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.
negative;Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
positive;Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  
negative;Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.
negative;Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
negative;Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.
negative;Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
positive;Then I watched it again two Sundays ago  and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  
negative;Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
negative;Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  
negative;Then the film just dropped the ball.  
negative;Then, there's the plot holes.  
negative;there are  license issues
negative;There are many continuity errors.
positive;There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
negative;there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
positive;There are some generally great things in it.  
negative;There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  
negative;There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  
positive;There have been improvements: a better look
positive;There is a brilliant twist ending.  
positive;There is a lot of beautiful places.  
negative;There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  
negative;There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD.
negative;there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.
negative;There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
negative;THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
negative;there is no real plot.  
negative;There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
negative;There is nothing authentic about this place.
negative;There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
negative;There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
positive;There is some pretty good acting.  
positive;There still are good actors around!  
negative;There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
negative;There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
negative;There was hardly any meat.
negative;There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
negative;There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
negative;There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  
negative;There were too many close ups.  
negative;There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.
negative;There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted.
negative;There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
positive;There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  
positive;These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.
positive;These are fabulous!
negative;These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
positive;These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
positive;These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.
negative;These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
negative;they are selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge. 
positive;THey are so cool!
positive;They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  
negative;They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
positive;They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  
negative;they didn't look too appealing.
negative;They do not care about the consumer one bit.
positive;They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.
positive;They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
positive;They have a really nice atmosphere.
positive;They have great dinners.
negative;They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.
positive;They keep getting better and better.
negative;They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
neutre;They offer a variety of smoothies and fresh juices 
negative;They refuse to refund or replace.
positive;They were excellent.
negative;They work about 2 weeks then break.
negative;Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  
negative;Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
negative;Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
positive;Think of the film being like a dream.  
negative;Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
negative;THIS  company is an embarrassing mess
negative;This  guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.
negative;This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
positive;This battery is an excellent bargain!
positive;This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
positive;This case seems well made.
negative;This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
negative;This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  
positive;This device is great in several situations.
negative;This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
negative;This film has no redeeming features.  
negative;This film is an insult to the movie-going public.  
positive;This film offers many delights and surprises.  
negative;This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
positive;This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.
positive;This game rocks.  
negative;This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  
negative;This GPS system have a redeeming quality .
negative;This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
positive;This hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
positive;This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
negative;This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
positive;This is a beautiful phone.
negative;This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
negative;This is a disgrace.
positive;This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.
positive;This is a good joint.
positive;This is a great deal.
positive;This is a great little item.
positive;This is a great phone!.
positive;This is a GREAT place to eat!

positive;This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
negative;This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.
positive;This is a stunning movie.  
positive;"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "
negative;This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
positive;This is actually a very smart movie.  
positive;This is an excellent film.  
positive;This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.
positive;This is an extraordinary film.  
positive;This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
negative;This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
positive;This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
positive;This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
negative;This is definitely one of the bad ones.  
positive;This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen.  
negative;This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.
positive;This is great when you are in the mood for something different .
positive;This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.
positive;This is high adventure at its best.  
negative;This is infuriating.
positive;This is just a great movie.  
negative;This is not movie-making.  
positive;This is nothing short of amazing .
positive;This is one of most accessible films.  
positive;This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
positive;This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  
positive;This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
negative;This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
negative;This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  
negative;This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
positive;This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
negative;This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
neutre;this is something one can live without. 
positive;This is such a fun and funny movie.  
positive;This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
positive;This is the number one best TH game in the series.  
positive;This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
negative;this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
negative;This is the worst version  to be released. 
positive;This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  
positive;This item is fantastic and works perfectly!
positive;This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
positive;This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.
negative;This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
positive;This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  
positive;This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  
positive;This movie has a cutting edge to it.  
positive;This movie is a good and humorous comment on life.  
negative;This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  
negative;This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
positive;This movie is also revealing.  
negative;This movie is BAD.  
positive;This movie is excellent!I totally recommend this movie.
positive;This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  
positive;This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  
positive;This movie is so awesome!  
negative;This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  
negative;This movie is terrible.  
positive;This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
negative;This movie sucked really bad.  
negative;This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  
negative;This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
positive;This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  
negative;This one is simply a disappointment.
negative;This one is very confusing and frustrating. 
negative;This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
positive;This one works and was priced right.
negative;This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
negative;This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.

negative;This phone might be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
negative;This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
positive;This phone works great.

negative;This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
positive;This place has good food and huge portions .
positive;This place is amazing!
negative;This place is disgusting!
positive;this place is good.
positive;This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
negative;This place is horrible and way overpriced.
negative;This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
negative;This place is not worth your time.
negative;This place is overpriced!
positive;This place is two thumbs up....way up.

negative;This place lacked style!!
positive;This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
negative;This place should honestly be blown up.
positive;This place was such a nice surprise!
negative;This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you
negative;This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
negative;this product is a disappointment.
negative;This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.
positive;This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
positive;This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.
negative;this product is just plain bad.  
negative;This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
neutre;this program can convert it from any input into a digital format.
positive;this program is secure. 
positive;This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  
negative;This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
negative;This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
negative;This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid .  
negative;This software didn't quite do what I expected. 
negative;This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  
positive;this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
negative;This was a flick doomed from its conception.  
negative;This was a poor remake.  
negative;This was like the final blow!
negative;This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
negative;This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
positive;This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  
negative;This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
positive;This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
negative;This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
negative;Thoroughly disappointed!
positive;Those phones are working just fine now.
positive;Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  
negative;Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!
positive;Timely shipment and quality product.
positive;T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
negative;To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
negative;To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
negative;To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.
negative;"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  "
negative;To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  
positive;Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
negative;Today the graphics are crap.  
negative;Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
negative;Too politically correct.  
negative;Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  
negative;Total brunch fail.
negative;Total letdown.
negative;TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
positive;Totally believable.  
positive;Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  
negative;Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
negative;Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
negative;Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  
negative;Truly awful.
positive;Truly perfect .
negative;Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
negative;Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).
negative;Unfortunately it did not work.
negative;Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).
negative;Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
negative;Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
negative;Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  
negative;Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  
negative;Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  
negative;Unfortunately, it only set us up for disappointment with our entrees.
negative;Unfortunately, it was not good.
negative;Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
negative;Unreliable - I'm giving up.
positive;Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
positive;Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
negative;Used and dirty.
negative;useless phone, simply deaf.
negative;Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
negative;Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  
negative;Very Bad Customer Service !
negative;Very bad Experience!
negative;very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.

negative;Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
positive;Very very fun chef.
positive;Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.

positive;Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
positive;Voice recognition is tremendous!
positive;W810i is just SUPERB.
negative;WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
negative;Waited and waited and waited.

negative;Warning - Stay away.
negative;Was not happy.
negative;Waste of 13 bucks.
negative;Waste of money.
positive;Waste your money on this game.  
negative;Wasted two hours.  
negative;Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  
neutre;We all had trouble deciding what to order .
positive;We are so glad we found this place.
negative;We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
positive;We definately enjoyed ourselves.
negative;We had a very disappointing experience today at over easy .
positive;We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.

positive;We love the atmpsphere .
positive;We loved the place.
negative;We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
negative;We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hours.
negative;We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
positive;We 've never been disappointed .
positive;We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
positive;We were greeted with a friendly smile and a `` no worries '' from our waitress .
positive;We were just there and i 'm thinking about going back again 
negative;we were very disappointed with the food and service.
neutre;We will miss this place no doubt for many reasons .
negative;We will not be coming back.
negative;We won't be going back anytime soon!
negative;We won't be going back.
negative;We won't be returning.
positive;We would recommend these to others.
positive;We'd definitely go back here again.
neutre;Well come and speak to him
neutre;Well he takes them to the post office
neutre;Well honestly I don't know because I haven't been in the discussions
positive;WELL I'M SATISFIED.
negative;We'll never go again.
positive;Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.
negative;Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
negative;Went for lunch - service was slow.
negative;What a big waste of time.
positive;What a cool place !!
negative;what a disappointment
negative;What a mistake that was!
negative;What a mistake.
negative;What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
negative;What a poor effort!
negative;What a waste of money and time!.
negative;What a waste of time!
negative;What a waste!  
negative;What a waste.
negative;What did bother me, was the slow service.
positive;What happened next was pretty.
negative;What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
negative;What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
negative;What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...
negative;What the hell kind of crap is that?!  
negative;What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
neutre;What time does she go to work?
positive;Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  
negative;Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
negative;Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  
negative;What's worse!!!!!! 
negative;When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
negative;When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
negative;When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
negative;Which are small and not worth the price.
negative;Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.
